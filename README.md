  2. determine the nightly rental price that would maximize the profits from each of these properties, if they were converted to short-term rentals.
  3. calculate which properties would have increased profits as short-term rentals.
  4. determine how profitable, overall, it would be if Watershed converted some of this client's properties into short-term rentals. 
  5. need to determine how much cash Watershed would need in order to realize any potential profits from converting the properties.

# Database description
1. the current monthly rent Watershed charges for all of their client’s 244 properties, as well as the property type and geographic location of those properties.
2. some general information about examples of short-term rental properties. This information can be used to get a sense of what kind of nightly rental price Watershed’s client’s properties could be listed for, if they were converted to short-term rentals.
